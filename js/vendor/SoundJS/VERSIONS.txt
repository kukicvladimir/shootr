- HTMLAudioPlugin now using tag loop property to provide more reliable looping
- WebAudioPlugin added a look ahead approach to enable smooth looping
- Updated WebAudioPlugin to use a specific panning model (equal power). Matches the sound quality of the other plugins
- Fixed an issue that stopped WebAudioPlugin from loading sound files other than ogg, mp3, and wav with PreloadJS
- Fixed playback for secondary sounds in HTMLAudio Plugin that affected Firefox
- Fixed an issue with duration for secondary sounds in HTMLAudioPlugin in Firefox
- Fixed issue where failed or interrupted sound channels could not be used, resulting in less instances available then
	expected.
- Updated file validation RegExp. Supports double-byte characters, prevents partial matches, better
	support for relative paths, improved matching of domains, and modified the "file name" match to
	include the extension (file.mp3 instead of file). The match arguments have not changed otherwise.

Version 0.4.0 [Feb 12, 2013]
************************************************************************************************************************

************************************************************************************************************************
- Class name change to createjs.Sound from createjs.SoundJS
- Added versions file that is automatically updated via the build process, which provides run-time
	version information on the new SoundJS object
- A few major performance updates
- Added default support for M4A, MP4, aiff, wma, and mid audio formats
- Changed how file extension support is determined so changes only need to be made to SoundJS
- Revised path parsing to support a larger range of file path formats
- Added sound registration and manifest registration allowing simple internal preloading, so Sounds can preload and play
	without PreloadJS.  This includes callback and EventDispatch as files load.
- Added default behavior to load src when play is called if src has not been registered or preloaded
- Removed global pause/resume
- Removed global setMasterVolume, in place of SoundJS.setVolume(), which is now global volume

- Changed mute() to getMute() and setMute() on SoundJS and SoundInstances
- Removed id-based lookup
- Revised plugin approach, and simplified internal APIs
- Added EventDispatcher functionality to SoundJS and SoundInstance
- Added onSuccess callback and success event to SoundInstance to report successful play.
- Official WebAudio support via the new WebAudioPlugin, which is now the default audio handler

- Changed setPosition() method on SoundInstance so it is available on stopped instances
- Changed getDuration() method on SoundInstance so it returns the duration of stopped instances, instead of 0
- Changed default values set when SoundJS.play is called so instances retain position, volume, and pan unless explicitly
	changed
- Replaced proxy on Sound with a proxy on createjs namespace, createjs.proxy(method, scope, args*);
- Fixed issue to how delay was handled in SoundInstance so it will not fire if pause() or stop() is called before
	playback begins
- Fixed issues with indexOf that were sometimes preventing stop/mute, etc.
- Fixed issue with initial mute state in FlashPlugin
- Fixed an issue in FlashPlugin that caused getDuration to always return 0
