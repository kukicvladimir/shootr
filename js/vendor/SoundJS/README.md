# SoundJS

SoundJS is a library to make working with audio on the web easier. It provides a consistent API for playing audio in
different browsers, including using a target plugin model to provide an easy way to provide additional audio plugins
like Web Audio, and a Flash fallback. A mechanism has been provided for easily tying in audio preloading to
[PreloadJS](http://preloadjs.com)


## Example
	createjs.Sound.addEventListener("fileload", handleLoadComplete);
	createjs.Sound.registerSound({src:"path/to/sound.mp3|path/to/sound.ogg", id:"sound"});
	function handleLoadComplete(event) {
		createjs.Sound.play("sound");
	}

## Classes

### [Sound](http://createjs.com/Docs/SoundJS/classes/Sound.html)
The core API for playing sounds. Call createjs.Sound.play(sound, ...options), and a sound instance is created that can be
used to control the audio, and dispatches events when it is complete, loops, or is interrupted.

### [SoundInstance](http://createjs.com/Docs/SoundJS/classes/SoundInstance.html)
A controllable sound object that wraps the actual plugin implementation, providing a consistent API for audio playback,
no matter what happens in the background. Sound instances can be paused, muted, and stopped; and the volume, pan (where
available), and position changed using the simple API.

### [WebAudioPlugin](http://createjs.com/Docs/SoundJS/classes/WebAudioPlugin.html)
The default, built-in plugin, which uses Web Audio APIs to playback sounds. Note that WebAudio will fail to load when
run locally, and the HTML audio plugin will be used instead.

### [HTMLAudioPlugin](http://createjs.com/Docs/SoundJS/classes/HTMLAudioPlugin.html)
The fallback built-in plugin, which manages audio playback via the HTML5 <audio> tag. This will be used in instances
where the WebAudio plugin is not available.

### [FlashPlugin](http://createjs.com/Docs/SoundJS/classes/FlashPlugin.html)
An additional plugin which uses a flash shim (and SWFObject) to playback audio using Flash. You must manually set up and
register this plugin.
